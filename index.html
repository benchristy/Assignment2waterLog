			   <h2>waterLog</h2>
		   <p.l>
			<br>waterLog will be an application in which people can obtain certain parameters from water in most main cities in Australia, later this will be increased from not only Australia but to most of the world's countries. These water parameters presented to the user will be derived through the provided tap water for the destination, all data for which will be provided through government and/or official company websites and databases. The end goal for this application is to provide easily accessible data across the world, especially in places that lack clean drinking water. 
			<br>The parameters that will be provided to the user include general water hardness, PH, chlorine, trace elements and more. These parameters can be helpful for many people from all different walks of life, people with health issues, appliances, professions to fish lovers will find this application helpful.
			<br>waterLog will source all relevant data listed from the city's water management website, we will compile all the relevant data into a database that is to be implemented into a mobile phone application and website. The data will be presented in the application/website in a clean, professional looking user-oriented design. The focus of these apps is to provide people with data surrounding the water near them, in a fast and easy way to interpret.<br>
			
			
			<br><br>The motivation behind waterLog came as a result of owning fish, I (Max Torti) had recently gotten into the hobby and needed specific water data. Fish require different water parameters depending on where they are naturally found, for example fish from Africa will require harder and less acidic water. While researching water in my area I had to go through multiple websites and applications to find what was relevant to me, however I still needed to buy a water test kit as I wasn’t familiar nor did I trust some of the data sources I used. waterLog hopes to remove this issue for other members of the public in the same situation, to provide clear data from valid sources such as the government issued water site for each city and state.
			<br>After studying the data surrounding water myself, I realised that an application that provided this data in an easy to interpret way would be very helpful. 
			<br>Water, however, isn’t only important to fish keeping. Water is the most important resource to humans; we need it to survive both to drink and eat as most of our food sources rely on water to grow. Due to this it makes waterLog relevant to different professions and needs, professions such as people who deal with hydroponics or choosing what pipes to lay for housing. 
			<br>People involved with hydroponics may need data surrounding what water they use in their systems, waterLog will be following all relevant posts from the water quality specialists assigned to water management systems across the country, to ensure all of the data we provide to users is accurate and up to date.
			<br>Water has a lot of beneficial attributes for the human body, such as calcium and magnesium. However, for some kitchen appliances some of these minerals will cause build ups of unwanted gunk, potentially posing health risks or damaging the appliance itself. This is an example of the usefulness of waterLog, as taps/water outlets are susceptible to build up.
			<br>Certain places in the world don’t offer safe drinking water through taps, providing these places with the data that determines if water is safe is crucial to human survival. Travellers who are visiting new countries might find value in the data we supply, as waterLog will be able to clearly distinguish the quality of water and if it is safe to drink. 
			<br>For us lucky few who live in cities that offer clean water from the tap, this data can even determine how different the water will taste from city to city (Hardness, PH, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium and Chlorine can all cause changes in waters taste, colour or even texture).<br>
			
			
			
			<br><br>waterLog will be an application and website in which the user either selects what city they live in on a map of Australia or they simply enter the city in the provided box, once they have either selected or written their city the data for that specific area is shown. The map of Australia will be interactive, users can hover over states and get the information they are seeking. Using this interactive map not only looks professional but also makes the data easy to obtain and interpret.
			<br>In the mobile phone application, we will have the same interactive map however we will add an option for text/voice input. Using text/voice input it furthers the ease of use for the user.
			<br>Once the application is downloaded to a user’s phone, it will ask permission to obtain the user’s position, using GPS as to address when notification is sent. The user can opt in or out of the GPS, if for example the user opts out, they can manually set their city/destination via text or speach or just leave it blank. The notifications will be sent whenever there is a change in the water quality, water containment and delivery infrastructure or contaminations in the user’s area. 
			<br>Notifications will be sent depending on the user's location, as the notifications will be surrounding changes to the user’s water management system of their city/state. If the user doesn’t enter their destination or enable GPS, the notifications will not be sent, however they can view all notifications in the app itself under the “notifications” tab.
			<br>The tools needed to create both the mobile phone app and the website are as follows:
			<br>•	A computer capable of running a programming encoder with access to the internet.
			<br>•	HTML
			<br>•	CSS
			<br>•	Java
			<br>•	JavaScript<br>
			<br>Potential tools needed in creation of waterLog:
			<br>•	MySQL
			<br>•	Python
			<br>•	Swift
			<br>The main skills required for constructing waterLog is programming, due to our project being completely software related there is little else needed. Knowledge in multiple different programming languages will be needed, HTML/CSS will be used to create the website, Java will be used to make the mobile phone application (for devices running Android)and JavaScript will be used to make the interactive map. 
			<br>Other programming languages may be needed for the creation of waterLog, MySQL may be needed to create a database in which all of the data is stored, Python may be needed to further extend the capabilities of the app and interactive map and Swift may be needed to create a version of the app for devices running IOS operating system.<br>
			
			
			
			<br><br>In the initial proposal for waterLog (or “Water Near You”, as it was called) the application was to use user entered data, with the user entered data it would calculate the mean and present that to new users. However, it was later discovered that this was not favourable as it relied too much on the user. Due to that it was decided to obtain the relevant data ourselves, to do so we will source it from sites such as: https://www.melbournewater.com.au/water-data-and-education/water-facts-and-history/why-melbournes-water-tastes-great/testing-water 
			<br>PDF’s can be found that supply the data needed from a credible source, one such PDF is entitled “Water Quality Annual Report 2018-19".
			<br>In response to the feedback from assignment 1, we will source the data ourselves, rather than relying on members of the public who use the waterLog to provide the data themselves. This feedback was completely understandable and greatly appreciated, as this means we won’t need to rely on the users to conduct any tests themselves. Outsourcing all the data further improves the ease of use for users, ensures the promotion of valid information and limits the size of database needed to run the application.
			<br>The intended outcome of the application and website will be an interactive map in which when the user hovers over a city in Australia, the data surrounding that city comes up in a text box. People using the Android app will be able to receive notifications on changes to their city’s water management system. As stated before, the data will be sourced from the city's water management/storage website, as to ensure the data is valid and relevant to current times.
			<br>The data in which we will provide to users will contain most if not all of the following (depending on the recent testing of water supply):
			<br>•	PH
			<br>•	Colour (Pt/Co)
			<br>•	Iron
			<br>•	Manganese
			<br>•	Fluoride
			<br>•	Calcium
			<br>•	Hardness
			<br>•	Magnesium
			<br>•	Nitrate
			<br>•	Alkalinity
			<br>We believe these are the most relevant elements to be derived from water, most water based activities or problems depend on the listed elements.<br>
			
			
			
			<br><br>waterLog’s main objective is to inform the public with valid data surrounding the water provided to them from their tap. waterLog initially will only provide information regarding main cities in Australia, however we hope to eventually branch it out into most countries of the world. waterLog can be extremely beneficial in countries that lack clean drinking water, as it can help to determine where people can obtain safe drinking water.
			<br>waterLog is beneficial to fish keepers as each species of fish require specific parameters, such as hardness and PH. Every water supply across the world can differ in parameters, some examples extremely. Due to this it is important for the fish owner to choose what species they decide, depending on what water is available to them. You can alter water PH/hardness however to do so it can be very expensive, and you may need to add chemicals.
			<br>Due to the importance of water in every human's life, having that information at the simple click of a button is very helpful. No matter the reason may it be health, work or leisure this project works into many markets. With this huge potential of influence and water being a resource that literally every human must encounter daily, waterLog is very relevant, practical and monetizable.

						 <h2>Project Description</h2>
				
					   <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
						<br><p.l>waterLog will be an application in which people can obtain pertinent water parameters for most main cities in Australia, later this will be expanded to most of the world's countries. <br>The water parameters presented to the user will be derived from the destination’s readily available tap water and all data will be gained through government and/or official company sources and databases.   </p.l>
					   </div>

					 <div class="row">
					</div>
					  <br><h2>Overview</h2>
					<div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
						<h4>Topic <br></h4>
						<p.l>The parameters provided to the user from the waterLog application will include, general water hardness, PH, chlorine, trace elements and more. <br>Water is the most crucial resource to humans and animal-kind alike, these parameters will potentially assist a vast variety of people, those with health concerns, those wanting to gain the best from their home appliances (some minerals in water can cause build up on and damage kitchen appliances), professional fields (hydroponics, construction), and animal lovers, especially aquatic. <br> 
						waterLog will source and collate the historical and current data reported by each major city’s multiple water management companies, we will compile all relevant information into a database to be deployed in a smart phone application and website. The data will be presented in a clean, professional looking user-oriented design. The focus will be to provide users with appropriate data in an instantaneous and uncomplicated way. </p.l><br><br>
						<h4>Motivation <br></h4>
						<p.l>The motivation behind waterLog came from one of our group members owning fish, Max Torti had recently purchased a fish tank and pet fish, so become interested in maintaining their optimal environmental conditions. <br>He discovered fish required varying water parameters, generally related to where they were naturally found (e.g. fish from Africa require harder and less acidic water). To modify the water in his fish tank to ensure it best suited his new fish, Max needed accurate, current data on the water. 
						Max discovered gaining this information was more complicated than he had expected, he searched multiple websites and applications to find the information available was lengthy scripts of data, unreliably sourced or not specific to his area. He soon conceded and bought himself a water test kit. </p.l><br><br>
						<h4>Landscape <br></h4>
						<p.l>We have been unable to find a website or application which provides similar water data tailored to the purposes we have outlined. Water Management companies around Australia have information available on their respective websites, however this data is generally in the form of a downloaded PDF with pages and pages of information. <br>There is a smart phone application which provides water catchment information, which provides data on the amount of water in our drinking catchments, not so much the mineral components of the water. <br>There are applications for detecting water underground or reminding users to drink the recommended amount of water each day for health purposes. 
						<br>A website similar to our proposed application is https://water.australianmap.net/physical_chemical/hardness/ <br>
						However, this website does not deliver the scope of parameters, collate or present the data to the user for a specific purpose and in a simple and targeted way, so we conclude there to be no comparable applications currently on the market and thus no competition. 
						</p.l>

				 <br> <h2>Aims</h2>
				  <br><p.l>Water is the most important resource to humans; we rely upon it for survival, from drinking to growing our food sources. 
					<br>waterLog aims to provide accessibility of accurate water data. We aim to deliver an easy to use platform which can be relied upon to provide valid data from reliable sources, at no cost to the user.
					<h4>Priority Goals</h4>
					
					Our priority will initially be to provide data for water in Melbourne, Australia. We intend to provide the most relevant information effecting common water-based activities. Elements included in this data will be: <br> 
					• PH Levels<br> 
					• Colour (Pt/Co) <br> 
					• Iron<br> 
					• Manganese<br>
					• Fluoride<br>  
					• Calcium<br>  
					• Hardness<br>  
					• Magnesium<br>  
					• Nitrate<br>  
					• Alkalinity<br>  
					*The provision of this data may vary from time to time and be dependent on the most recent testing results. <br>
					We then hope to grow this data to a national level, covering all major cities in Australia. Australia is lucky enough to count most of its main water systems as safe and consumable. However, those who travel within Australia, will agree there are differing water taste between the cities. waterLog will break down the chemical components causing these taste variations (Hardness, PH, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium and Chlorine can all cause changes in waters taste, colour or even texture). 
					Our end goal for this application is to provide easily accessible data from across the world, especially in places that lack clean drinking water. <br>waterLog data will clearly distinguish a locations quality of water and its safe consumption for humans. Locals and travellers equally, will find value in the data. 
					</p.l>

			<div class="row">
			</div>
			  <h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
			  <br><p.l>Our scope is to create a simple application which allows users to see the water parameters and conditions in their current location (taken from their GPS signal) or a location of their choosing. Imminently, we are planning our focus on Melbourne, Australia, to ensure we have the capacity to identify and remedy any application glitches or limitations. <br>Once streamlined, we will broaden our data field to include significant locations in Australia and the world. Gathering this data will prove involved, so will require substantial resources. </p.l>

		<div class="row">
		</div>
		  <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
		  <br><p.l>Once the application is downloaded to a user’s phone, it will ask permission to obtain the user’s position, using GPS as to address when notification is sent. The user can opt in or out of the GPS, if for example the user opts out, they can manually set their city/destination via text or speech or just leave it blank. <br>Notifications will appear whenever there is a change in water quality, water containment and delivery infrastructure or contaminations in a user’s selected area. <br><br> 
 
			Notifications will be sent depending on the user's location, as the notifications will be surrounding changes to the user’s water management system of their city/state. If the user doesn’t enter their destination or enable GPS, the notifications will not be sent, however they can view all notifications in the app itself under the “notifications” tab. <br><br>  
			 
			The tools needed to create both the mobile phone app and the website are as follows: <br><br>  
			• A computer capable of running a programming encoder with access to the internet. <br>  
			• HTML<br>  
			• CSS<br>  
			• Java<br>  
			• JavaScript<br> 
			 
			<br>Potential tools needed in creation of waterLog: <br><br>  
			• MySQL<br>  
			• Python<br> 
			• Swift<br>  
			 
			The main skills required for constructing waterLog is programming, due to our project being completely software related there is little else needed. Knowledge in multiple different programming languages will be needed, HTML/CSS will be used to create the website, Java will be used to make the mobile phone application (for devices running Android)and JavaScript will be used to make the interactive map. <br>  
			Other programming languages may be needed for the creation of waterLog, MySQL may be needed to create a database in which all of the data is stored, Python may be needed to further extend the capabilities of the app and interactive map and Swift may be needed to create a version of the app for devices running IOS operating system. <br> 
			To store our data and host our application, we will look to operate via cloud services, a PaaS server for data storage and an IaaS service to host the applications themselves. waterLog chose to go for an IaaS service as we feel it is the most customisable and offers more freedom, as we decide the operating system and overall setup of the server and its software. 
			</p.l>

	<div class="row">
	</div>
	  <br><h2>Testing</h2>
	  <br><p.l>Testing will be completed internally initially, however, once we know the application is functional at its base level we plan to introduce the Usertesting platform (usertesting.com) to find 5-10 beta testers in Melbourne to test and ensure the application is functioning and providing the correct data, it will also be useful to see how easy they find the user interface and flow of the application. <br>Usertesting also records their screens and asks them to share their thoughts so it will offer us a better understanding of the applications limitations and areas to improve on for the future release. </p.l>

<div class="row">
</div>
  <br><h2>Risks</h2>
  <p.l>•	Copy write laws restricting our access to fundamental data and information. <br> 
	•	Our team’s entry level skill set for building applications may constrain our production ability. <br>

	<h2>Plans and Progress<br>
	<h6>How it started:</h6> 
	
	<p.l>As a very diverse group we naturally have a varying array of hobbies between us. One of our members, Max, had large fish tanks filled with exotic fish. This initial inspiration nurtured the idea of an application to give the correct information about the water in your area/city. <br> 
	
	We created waterlog as a way the anyone could obtain all the information that they could possibly need about your local water. </p.l> 
	
	  
	
	<br> <br><h6>What it will do?</h6>
	
	<p.l> waterLog will be an application for both mobile phones and computer, this application will be free of charge to users. The focus for waterLog is to provide legitimate and relevant data surrounding water to the public, to inform them of relevant information of the water quality near them. <br> 
	The design focus of the waterLog application is to provide all necessary data in a clean, professional, user oriented and easily understandable design. <br> 
	
	 
	All applications offered by waterLog will have the same GUI, unless decided against in the future. waterLog's GUI will include multiple tabs including FAQ, settings and notifications. The core of the waterLog GUI will be a map of the user entered country, in which they can click on cities/states to see the water data for that given area. <br><br> 
	Users will be prompted on the first launch of the waterLog application to either allow location tracking, or enter their location manually. This is so we can present the relevant map on their screen, and to provide them with notifications regarding their location. The user can decide to manually input their location, or even leave it blank and use the search bar to find the data they are seeking. <br> 
	Currently the computer application is the only service we offer, however we are planning on creating the mobile phone variants in the coming weeks. The mobile phone variants will include both IOS and Android operating systems. Data for Melbourne's water quality is the only current information we present to users, as this is our ‘beta’ stage of production. With the creation of the waterLog mobile phone applications, we will be adding more data for different regions in the world. <br><br> 
	
	 
	The application consists of a database – currently made using Java, however as the data increases, we will move to a database focused language such a SQL. <br> 
	The database will store all data for each region of the world we offer our services to, the database was built so that when a user clicks on a city/state the information regarding that area is shown. The database will be maintained by its creator, Andrew Rijs, with all up-to-date information sourced from government or water treatment plant reports and websites. <br> 
	waterLog will also have a FAQ page, in which will list many beneficial facts and tips for users from many different professions/hobbies. Users will have the option to create accounts with waterLog, with this they can save multiple preferred locations to quickly ‘travel’ to them on the map. Users with accounts can also sign up to receive emails from our developers and team members, with updates on any new updates coming to waterLog and helpful information regarding water.<br><br> 
	<br><br> <img src="	https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100183276-3b013980-2f2a-11eb-8c66-b64a2e6b4be7.png"height=20% width=20% class=UIPhoto1>
	<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100183359-76036d00-2f2a-11eb-831e-4b67dcb659ce.png"height=20% width=20% class=UIPhoto2>
	<br><br><br>waterLog will be hosted using a PaaS plan, as our current team doesn’t have the hardware or premises to use our own servers. 
	<br> 
	
	waterLog will be an application that is free to use, that will inform users of water data in regions across the world. Our goal at waterLog is to promote the education surrounding relevant water data and information. Water data is relevant for many professions, health, leisure and appliance needs, as a result millions of people can find use out of our app. 
	waterLog will be completely transparent regarding user privacy, ensuring your data is always protected. Due to waterLog being a free application, the money generated will be through promoting advertisement on our platforms. WaterLog will never sell any user related data, user data such as location will only be used to show notifications. Other than notifications all other data is simply unneeded, therefore we disregard it after assigning users to the chosen location. Our database will be fully encrypted and protected from leading cyber security experts.<br><br>
	  
	 
	
	waterLog's aim is to provide the general public with a source for easily accessible data surrounding water, this is relevant to many fields and leisure activities. waterLog will also provide information surrounding water through an FAQ tab in the application. 
	Once waterLog is out of the ‘beta’ stage and starts gaining more countries data, this application can be used to potentially save human lives. With many countries not having easily accessible clean drinking water, this application can help tourists determine where they can or can’t drink. 
	waterLog aims to do this all free to the end user, only gaining revenue through advertisements and donations, while also ensuring all user data is encrypted and protected. </p.l> 
	 
	 
	
	<br> <br> <h6>How will it do it?</h6> 
	
	<p.l> The waterLog application will be made for pc and ios/android devices. The application consists of a simple, yet professional looking GUI in which any user should understand its use immediately. The core aspect of this GUI is an interactive map, of which when the user selects a region the stats of available water management systems will be shown. 
	<br> 
	Upon initial launch of the waterLog applications, all data will be stored in a Java database. However, as the userbase and data grows over time, a more fitting SQL database will be created. Using this Java database, the GUI presents the user with reliable and up-to date data. 
	
	 <br> 
	
	In addition to the MVP java database/ui we will be making an Entity-Relationship Model diagram as the next step before creating an SQL database. 
	 <br> 
	ER Models are what you use to conceptualize and define key elements of data before committing to creating the database and includes entities (ie. 'Location ID', 'Location', 'Information Source', 'pH', 'Fluoride Content'), keys and relationships as core concepts. 
	 <br> 
	The diagram we make will use these concepts, as well as crow's feet notation to map out the transition to a fully-functioning database. </p.l> 
	  
	<br><br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100183616-1bb6dc00-2f2b-11eb-9f10-cf12a5e8b718.png"height=80% width=80% class=imgcenter>
	
	  
	
	 
	
	  
	
	  
	
	<br> <br> <h6>The story of the project?</h6>  
	
	<p.l> Our project plan “waterLog” has seen massive changes throughout the last 2 months, with it initially only being focused on providing fish keepers valuable information, to providing potentially lifesaving information to the whole world. Our group found many ways people can benefit from data surrounding water in their local area, may it be profession, leisure or for simple consumption. <br> 
	
	 
	waterLog originally started to help fish keepers, as I (Max Torti) own fish myself. The initial plan was to develop a GUI that would control a database, in this database would be certain water parameters for each state of Australia. I found that water parameters can be extremely important when keeping fish, parameters such as hardness and PH. <br><br> 
	
	 
	While working with the waterLog team during assignment 2, the project plan started to expand its horizons. Due to our group being very diverse, each member found different professions and activities that could benefit from the parameters we would provide. Our plan began to include aspects that people other than fish keepers could find useful, such as elements in the water that may impact plumbing and shower/tap outlets.  
	The plan for the software itself stayed relatively the same, however as time went on, we further grew our idea regarding the core aspects of the application. We cemented the idea to make a GUI that included a map of Australia, when a user hovers their mouse over cities in Australia, the data of water provided through the tap for that location would be listed. It was decided for the initial launch waterLog would only serve Australia, however we plan to expand our services to the rest of the world as time goes on. <br><br> 
	
	  
	
	Once the main aspects of waterLog was formed and we began thinking about prototypes, multiple features were brought up that could help our users. Features such as an FAQ tab could help expand our relevancy to people with different interests/needs, such as providing information regarding common problems surrounding water.  
	We decided to use Java when developing the backend of our application, as our group members had the most experience with this language. We used Java to store all data surrounding water in a small and simple database. Currently waterLog is only a computer application but once we expand, we will also introduce a mobile phone application for both IOS and Android devices. <br> 
	
	  
	
	<br>Throughout the lifespan of waterLog, there have been several large changes. waterLog went from a tool for a small hobby, to being applicable and potentially helpful to all human beings. waterLog is currently a computer application, with helpful aspects such as a responsive map, FAQ tab and relevant up to date information surrounding water data.  
	We offer our services to residence of Melbourne Australia and the surrounding area, in the coming months we will be developing a mobile phone application, while also increasing the number of countries we offer our services to.  
	</p.l> 
	 
	
	<br> <br> <h6>How far we have come developing features?</h6>  
	
	<br><p.l> Initially the project was going to be simply an archive of information for the public to use. After discussions with the team, we realized that much more was possible with the initial idea. From a simple archive we started developing extra features. <br> 
	
	We have several features that make the design component of our application. The first feature that was discussed was a modular map of Australia that shows the water quality and the chemical parameters for the most populated areas of the region. (shown below). This gives what could have been a drop down list a professional looking platform to convey the information to our audience. The map will be created using java and it will run off a table of information built in Java also.  <br> 
	
	Another design feature is the front-end UI that we are using to convey information. The screenshot below demonstrates our straightforward user-friendly user interface. Using this UI we have displayed our other quality of life features like our FAQ and our Search Bar. </p.l> <br><br>
	<br><br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100183327-5d935280-2f2a-11eb-96cd-dc4804492b5f.png"height=20% width=20% class=UIPhoto1>
	<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100183348-6b48d800-2f2a-11eb-822a-49d530e7aa4c.png"height=20% width=20% class=UIPhoto2>
	
	<br>
	
	  
	
	<br> <br> <h6>Why are we doing waterlog?</h6>
	
	<br><p.l> WaterLog was originally designed for fish keepers. Certain fish require very specific circumstances in order to survive in a fish tank. These parameters can include but are not limited to, PH level, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, water hardness and color. Although the original reason for the development of waterLog was very specific, there is a large amount of both commercial and residential application. The WaterLog application was originally constructed because of a need for a hub of information. We are designing a central source of information where you will be able to learn all the details that you may need about your city's drinking water. <br><br> 
	
	Upon a google search of the water in an area we realized that there are so many different reports and sources all focusing on one aspect of the water, making it hard to find the most recent figures for all the permeameters that you might need to meet for specific vocations like fine gardening and fish keeping. Even when you find the most recently updated water parameters for the area, you will have to filter through the other 30 pages of information to make sure you receive all the relevant information you need.  You will not need to do hours of study on multiple different websites, all with different results or wait a week for a water testing kit to arrive to be able to reliably test a water source. With waterLog you will be able to know exactly what you will need to know about the water available in an area in seconds. <br><br> 
	
	  
	
	There are a few vocations or hobbies that could make more use of the waterLog application than others. These hobbies are arguably our number one audience as these people will consistently check the application which means that they either have more chance of buying the ad free monetized version or just simply viewing more ads on the application to raise revenue to further the project. The hobbies or vocations that will most likely find this application helpful are listed below, these will be our target audience: <br> 
	
	Fish Owners <br> 
	
	Fine Gardeners <br> 
	
	Pool Owners <br> 
	
	Pets Owners (mostly for dental health) <br> 
	
	People with specific water needs (either medical or preference) <br> 
	
	Industrial Agricultural applicantion  <br> 
	
	  
	
	There is a multitude of reasons that the public will need access to information like this. When moving into a new town/city we often look at the public transport options, the noise levels at your location, local amenities and even infrastructure. There will rarely be any attention drawn to the most important resource available to us as organisms, water. We often associate issues with drinking water with less developed countries. Tates is one he United St of the largest and most fundamentally developed countries in the world. Yet they have 32 million cases of waterborne disease that occur nationwide every year. (https://theconversation.com/the-us-drinking-water-supply-is-mostly-safe-but-thats-not-good-enough-115028) </p.l><br><br> <br><br> 
	
	<h2>Project Description</h2>
				
	<div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
	 <br><p.l>waterLog will be an application in which people can obtain pertinent water parameters for most main cities in Australia, later this will be expanded to most of the world's countries. <br>The water parameters presented to the user will be derived from the destination’s readily available tap water and all data will be gained through government and/or official company sources and databases.   </p.l>
	</div>

  <div class="row">
 </div>
   <br><h2>Overview</h2>
 <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
	 <h6>Topic <br></h6>
	 <p.l>The parameters provided to the user from the waterLog application will include, general water hardness, PH, chlorine, trace elements and more. <br>Water is the most crucial resource to humans and animal-kind alike, these parameters will potentially assist a vast variety of people, those with health concerns, those wanting to gain the best from their home appliances (some minerals in water can cause build up on and damage kitchen appliances), professional fields (hydroponics, construction), and animal lovers, especially aquatic. <br> 
	 waterLog will source and collate the historical and current data reported by each major city’s multiple water management companies, we will compile all relevant information into a database to be deployed in a smart phone application and website. The data will be presented in a clean, professional looking user-oriented design. The focus will be to provide users with appropriate data in an instantaneous and uncomplicated way. </p.l><br><br>
	 <h6>Motivation <br></h6>
	 <p.l>The motivation behind waterLog came from one of our group members owning fish, Max Torti had recently purchased a fish tank and pet fish, so become interested in maintaining their optimal environmental conditions. <br>He discovered fish required varying water parameters, generally related to where they were naturally found (e.g. fish from Africa require harder and less acidic water). To modify the water in his fish tank to ensure it best suited his new fish, Max needed accurate, current data on the water. 
	 Max discovered gaining this information was more complicated than he had expected, he searched multiple websites and applications to find the information available was lengthy scripts of data, unreliably sourced or not specific to his area. He soon conceded and bought himself a water test kit. </p.l><br><br>
	 <h6>Landscape <br></h6>
	 <p.l>We have been unable to find a website or application which provides similar water data tailored to the purposes we have outlined. Water Management companies around Australia have information available on their respective websites, however this data is generally in the form of a downloaded PDF with pages and pages of information. <br>There is a smart phone application which provides water catchment information, which provides data on the amount of water in our drinking catchments, not so much the mineral components of the water. <br>There are applications for detecting water underground or reminding users to drink the recommended amount of water each day for health purposes. 
	 <br>A website similar to our proposed application is https://water.australianmap.net/physical_chemical/hardness/ <br>
	 However, this website does not deliver the scope of parameters, collate or present the data to the user for a specific purpose and in a simple and targeted way, so we conclude there to be no comparable applications currently on the market and thus no competition. 
	 </p.l>
 </div>

<div class="row">
</div>
<br> <h6>Aims</h6>
<p.l>Water is the most important resource to humans; we rely upon it for survival, from drinking to growing our food sources. 
 <br>waterLog aims to provide accessibility of accurate water data. We aim to deliver an easy to use platform which can be relied upon to provide valid data from reliable sources, at no cost to the user.
 <br><br><h4>Priority Goals</h4>
 
 Our priority will initially be to provide data for water in Melbourne, Australia. We intend to provide the most relevant information effecting common water-based activities. Elements included in this data will be: <br> 
 • PH Levels<br> 
 • Colour (Pt/Co) <br> 
 • Iron<br> 
 • Manganese<br>
 • Fluoride<br>  
 • Calcium<br>  
 • Hardness<br>  
 • Magnesium<br>  
 • Nitrate<br>  
 • Alkalinity<br>  
 *The provision of this data may vary from time to time and be dependent on the most recent testing results. <br>
 We then hope to grow this data to a national level, covering all major cities in Australia. Australia is lucky enough to count most of its main water systems as safe and consumable. However, those who travel within Australia, will agree there are differing water taste between the cities. waterLog will break down the chemical components causing these taste variations (Hardness, PH, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium and Chlorine can all cause changes in waters taste, colour or even texture). 
 Our end goal for this application is to provide easily accessible data from across the world, especially in places that lack clean drinking water. <br>waterLog data will clearly distinguish a locations quality of water and its safe consumption for humans. Locals and travellers equally, will find value in the data. 
 </p.l>

<div class="row">
</div>
<br><h6>Scopes and Limits</h6>
<br><p.l>Our scope is to create a simple application which allows users to see the water parameters and conditions in their current location (taken from their GPS signal) or a location of their choosing. Imminently, we are planning our focus on Melbourne, Australia, to ensure we have the capacity to identify and remedy any application glitches or limitations. <br>Once streamlined, we will broaden our data field to include significant locations in Australia and the world. Gathering this data will prove involved, so will require substantial resources. </p.l>

<div class="row">
</div>
<br><h6>Tools and Technologies</h6>
<br><p.l>Once the application is downloaded to a user’s phone, it will ask permission to obtain the user’s position, using GPS as to address when notification is sent. The user can opt in or out of the GPS, if for example the user opts out, they can manually set their city/destination via text or speech or just leave it blank. <br>Notifications will appear whenever there is a change in water quality, water containment and delivery infrastructure or contaminations in a user’s selected area. <br><br> 

Notifications will be sent depending on the user's location, as the notifications will be surrounding changes to the user’s water management system of their city/state. If the user doesn’t enter their destination or enable GPS, the notifications will not be sent, however they can view all notifications in the app itself under the “notifications” tab. <br><br>  

The tools needed to create both the mobile phone app and the website are as follows: <br><br>  
• A computer capable of running a programming encoder with access to the internet. <br>  
• HTML<br>  
• CSS<br>  
• Java<br>  
• JavaScript<br> 

<br>Potential tools needed in creation of waterLog: <br><br>  
• MySQL<br>  
• Python<br> 
• Swift<br>  

The main skills required for constructing waterLog is programming, due to our project being completely software related there is little else needed. Knowledge in multiple different programming languages will be needed, HTML/CSS will be used to create the website, Java will be used to make the mobile phone application (for devices running Android)and JavaScript will be used to make the interactive map. <br>  
Other programming languages may be needed for the creation of waterLog, MySQL may be needed to create a database in which all of the data is stored, Python may be needed to further extend the capabilities of the app and interactive map and Swift may be needed to create a version of the app for devices running IOS operating system. <br> 
To store our data and host our application, we will look to operate via cloud services, a PaaS server for data storage and an IaaS service to host the applications themselves. waterLog chose to go for an IaaS service as we feel it is the most customisable and offers more freedom, as we decide the operating system and overall setup of the server and its software. 
<br><br><br>
As in Assignment 2, the tools we have used are Microsoft Teams, Git-Hub, Git-Hub CMD, TextEdit, Sublime text and Visual Studio, MySQL<br>

	Continuing with our communication platform from Assignment 2, we used Microsoft Teams to conduct and record meetings, for general communication and to upload and share files and documents.<BR>
	
	To create our new website for this assignment, we forked a copy of our Assignment 2 website which was hosted on Github. We experienced a sharp learning curve with the operation of Github from Assignment 2, initially each group member was coding, uploading, and committing their individual work, however, this was causing previously committed work to be over-ridden. For this assignment and per advice from our course tutors, we assigned roles for Github. Max was responsible for coding all content, which he then sent to Ben, who uploaded it to the Github repository. This was a much smoother and more reliable process, which is represented by the trimmer commit record trail.<br>
<br><br>Here is the current computer variant of our application:
<br><br> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70696652/100231530-e0400000-2f72-11eb-98b6-ff25876d77e2.PNG"height=80% width=80% class=imgcenter>
</p.l>

<div class="row">
</div>
<br><h6>Testing</h6>
<br><p.l>Testing will be completed internally initially, however, once we know the application is functional at its base level we plan to introduce the Usertesting platform (usertesting.com) to find 5-10 beta testers in Melbourne to test and ensure the application is functioning and providing the correct data, it will also be useful to see how easy they find the user interface and flow of the application. <br>Usertesting also records their screens and asks them to share their thoughts so it will offer us a better understanding of the applications limitations and areas to improve on for the future release. </p.l>

<div class="row">
</div>
<br><h6>Risks</h6>
<p.l>•	Copy write laws restricting our access to fundamental data and information. <br> 
•	Our team’s entry level skill set for building applications may constrain our production ability. <br> 
•	Associated costs for expert services to assist and supplement our group skill sets could challenge our budget. <br> 
•	Funding impediments, we aim to raise revenue through paid advertising which will be sort during the development phase. There is no guarantee the revenue raised will cover the set-up costs, leaving us in financial trouble.

  <p>We have remained the same group from Assignment 2, so have found ourselves already settled into a communication and processes routine. We have varying schedules outside this course; however, each team member manages contact at least two to four times a week (if not more when content is being finalised) with the other team members responding within 24 – 48 hours. <br> 
	We meet virtually in recorded meetings twice a week on Thursdays and Sundays via Microsoft Teams, each meeting has an updated agenda for confirmation of discussion points and future referral and clarification. <br>Between formal meetings, we communicate using notes, content upload and chats on the Microsoft Teams group board. All team members agree and are compliant with our communication frequency and method.

							<h3>About me</h3><br>
						 Student ID: 3829774. <br>
						 Student Email: S3829774@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
						 Born in East Gippsland (Vic), I spent some time living in Sydney (2 years) and Melbourne (6 years) before returning to my home town to raise a family. 
						 My previous education has been in Audio Engineering and Healthcare (nursing), and I am now studying IT to gain a deeper understanding of a field that has 
						 always been of great interest to me. Enrolled via OUA, being able to live in the country and still study at a well-respected university like RMIT is a great 
						 blessing, as well as a testament to the subject I'm enrolled in. Outside of computers, I also have a keen interest in motorcycles and musicianship. 
						 <br>
						 <h3>Interest in IT/Experience </h3><br>
						 My IT experience is essentially years as hobbiest. Have dabbled in networking, mod-making and some limited coding. Professionally I have held several jobs 
						 that required basic IT skills, one in particular (transcribing online for Nuance Communications) required a higher than average knowledge of IT to get the work done.

                         2019 brought with it my first child and my 30th birthday, which made me consider a new career path for some stability and longevity. IT has always been a great interest to me, so it seemed to be a natural choice. I have spent a lot of time using technology in my live  music set up, and I am more than eager to be on the other side of the fence. At present, I am interested in following a path to becoming a Front End Developer, but I am open to that changing as this journey unfolds.

						<h2>About Me:</h2>
						<br>I am from Gold Coast Australia, born 2003 and have completed a certificate 3 in tourism and grade 10. One fact about myself is that when I was 15, I made a bitcoin mining machine, using 2 rx 570 graphics cards and a second hand motherboard, cpu, ram and powersupply. Mining rigs are getting less and less viable, so once the rig’s profitability dropped, I dismantled it and used the parts in desktop PC’s. However even though I didn’t mine for long, it really pushed my interest in IT to the next level.
						<h2>Interest In IT:</h2>
						<br>I have knowledge in Java, MySQL, and I know a little HTML/CSS. I am planning on learning Javascript and Python in the future. With this knowledge both now and soon to be learnt, I am most interested in data centres for my future job, I feel that as our world has accepted technology and the population keeps growing, Data management is a field that will be in high demand.
						<h2>IT Experience:</h2>
						<br>I don’t have any professional experience in the IT field yet, however I have assembled computers for friends for a profit.<br>

						 <!--Team Profile-->
						   <p.1><h1>Team Profile</h1></p.1>
						  
<br><p.l>Our team has taken various personality tests to help indicate how we will function together .

					<p.l>A Myers-Briggs test by 16 Personalities reveals that we have a Protagonist, an Architect, a Logician, a Virtuoso and two Mediators. 
					With this information, we can speculate on how the group may function as the project unfolds. <br><br>

				The Protagonist would take a leadership and organisation role, especially in the initial formation of the group. 
				The Architect and Logician may come up with the initial blueprints of the idea, with the Virtuoso also having significant input.<br> <br>

					Off of the cusp, abstract ideas will often be contributed by the mediators and the Virtuoso, as well as other members of the team. 
					The mediators and the protagonist will also be available to help the Architect, Logician and Virtuoso in communicating their ideas effectively with the group. <br><br>

					The team has also individually taken a combination of learning styles tests, which has shown that we have a broad mix of learning preferences. 
					The groups balance of auditory, visual, kinaesthetic and other learning styles will give us a healthy range of ideas and problem solving techniques to utilise from. <br><br>

						Finally, a big 5 test reveals that our team is quite mixed in makeup. Most members are at partially extroverted, however some are not. 
						This will mean that our team must be conscious of being inclusive with sharing input, and asking everybody for their opinions.  
					Most team members are generally quite agreeable, which will hopefully mean collaboration is easy for us during group meetings. 
						Most of our team members scored highly in openness/imagination and will be able to contribute creative ideas to our final project.<br><br>

					Overall our group has a strong mix of personalities and  learning methods which will allow for a diverse range of ideas and opinions. 
					Our hope is that this group dynamic is rich enough that everyone will have had a strong role to play in the overall project.

	 <p> <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1></p>

	 <p.l>With Information Technology being such a broad field, there is room for many types of people to have a role in the industry. The waterLog team has a diverse range of personality types. As such, it seems fitting that we would all have very different plans for our career paths. 
<br><br>
Our ideal jobs have some soft skills in common. As IT is a teamwork based industry, communication skills are a highly sought after skill in most roles. Most of our ideal jobs also have a strong emphasis on problem solving and analytical skills. 
<br><br>
The technical skillsets for each job we have selected are unique from each other. The programmer roles overlap in many ways however there are differences between Front End and PHP Developers. While the Front will generally focus on visual development, The PHP developer is more likely to focus their work in the back end, and be highly proficient in SQL.PHP and Front-End developers will both generally be competent in JavaScript. 
<br><br>
The business analyst role is unique in that it is  a hybrid role, i.e implementing  technology to utilise a business skillset. Data analysis is something that a business analyst will need to be proficient in, which broadly overlaps with with PHP development (As SQL is a language used for data management).  
Data Centre Technicians and Network engineers, also handle data but in a very different way from an analyst. These roles  more focus on the administration, maintenance and handling of data networks. Both will generally have experience working in data centres.  
<br><br>
Cyber security is unique to the rest of our job choices, as it is centred around protecting data from intentional threats. However there is some overlap with the Developer roles in terms of being tailored to businesses needs and designing applications accordingly. <p.l>

						   <h2><p> Has my opinion changed and why? </h2>
 

<h6>Imogen Leaver: Business Analyst </h6>
 

My ideal job is considered a hybrid skill set, combining general IT skills with finance, and accounting specific skills. Looking at the Burning Glass data provided, it shows little demand for business analytics, however, with a broader search, I can see great demand for hybrid jobs, which combine ‘traditional’ job sets with IT, data science and analytics. Burning Glass data shows over 1.7 million job advertisements specifying data science skills in 2018 and 617,300 total openings for jobs such as financial analysts and data scientists, so I am confident there is growing demand for my ideal job as a Business Analyst.

 

<h6>Henry Robinson: Front end developer. </h6>


After considering the Burning glass data, I am still very happy with my ideal job. Front end development roles are placed 6th in both occupation and job title jobs data. Specifically, there were 5,990 listings in the occupation listings, which makes me feel very optimistic. The biggest challenge for me will be developing the technical skillset required, as I am very new to coding in general. It is very comforting for me to see that there is high demand, as it only furthers my motivations to attain this kind of work. It’s also worth noting that JAVAscript is the 2nd most required IT skill in the listings, which means there may also be room for crossover into other roles.

 

<h6>Andrew Rijs: PHP Developer </h6>

 

Whilst the job listing I pursued is relatively unpopular (24th, 277 Listings), several of the essential skills required are the most common technical skills job advertisements ask for (with SQL in first and JavaScript in second). In addition to these technical skills, the generic skill required (good problem solving) is the second most required attribute in the burning glass analysis. This gives me confidence that if I choose to gain a skillset in these areas, I will be able to find work that fits closely to my initial ideal job. Having had a brief introduction to these languages in previous studies has further informed my decision that this is a path I'd like to go down. 

 

 

<h6>Max Torti: Data centre technician. </h6>

 

 

Throughout the span of these last few weeks I have been considering my ideal job, I still thoroughly enjoy the idea of working as a data centre technician. The skills needed fit my interests, such as hardware repair, IT computer networking and troubleshooting skills. I have always loved making computers, troubleshooting them and seeing what I can tweak to further improve them (overclocking), I am also eager to learn more about the fields of networks and cybersecurity. Data centre technicians are required to be good with communicating with people, they are expected to give support and educate clients. With all of this in mind I feel that the role of data center technician fits nicely. 

However, after reviewing the burning glass data I have some worries. Burning glass explains data centre technicians as not working a regular 9-5 job, I have no problem with this as of right now, however my opinion might change as life goes on. With this mystery surrounding hours I begin to worry about job security and income. 

 

<h6>Benjamin Christy: Senior network engineer. </h6>
 

After looking at the burning glass data I still consider being a network engineer as my ideal job. 

There are currently 2,478 active job listings and the 5-year projected job growth (according to seek.com.au) is 26.2%. The skills and qualifications for the position also overlap and open up other doors for several different fields in the IT industry. This makes me feel very confident with my career choice and gives me the ability to move around in the industry if I feel like I need to do so. 
 

<h6>Liam O'Dell: Cyber Security Specialist </h6>

After looking into the various types of employment in cyber security I would consider Cyber Security Specialist or a similar position my ideal job. As different companies advertise positions with different titles it is hard to compare the positions. It is the industry that entices me so other related positions like Cyber Security Analyst and Cyber Security Engineer also are very attractive options in the future. Out the first 5 active job listings on Seek, all 5 of them list interpersonal or communication skills as the most in demand skill for this job. This gives me confidence that I can continue to work towards this position as the burning glass data suggests that this the top In Demand baseline skill and I work very diligently on having great interpersonal and communication skills. I have always known that my ideal job would be require high levels of communication and think that it is one of my strong suits.

		 <h1>Group Reflection</h1> 

 

<h2>Individual Reflections </h2> 

 

<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Imogen Leaver</h6> 
<h4>What went well? </h4>  

<p.l>Having remained the same group from Assignment 2, we were familiar with each other and how we worked together. This was an asset as we could delegate tasks promptly, knowing with confidence each member would complete their task in the designated timeframe, with skill, whilst playing to their strengths.   </p> 

<h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>It was the consensus from Assignment 2, that our area for improvement was IT knowledge and skills. I felt the group made real progress in this area, we certainly improved our GITHUB control and application. We still have room for improvement, with most of us being at the beginning of our IT journey, this is no surprise.  </p.l> 

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l>Our group members are so different and picked each other at such random, however, have managed to really meld and support each other through this process. It has been a difficult time to study, with some of us under COVID restrictions and experiencing upheaval in our personal lives, we have nonetheless prevailed.  </p> 

<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>I am used to the traditional ‘line of authority’ in the workplace, I was accustomed to this being the effective way to manage a project, I have found with this group work, we have all stood to task and worked cohesively towards each goal with a successful outcome.  </p> 

 
<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Andrew Rijs </h6> 

<h4>What went well? </h4>  

<p.l>The dynamics of our group had already formed into a strong unit during our work on assignment 2, and this translated well to assignments 3 and 5 as well. There has been an attitude from all team members of ‘what can I do to help the team?’, and this has made working together a breeze over all assignments.</p> 

<h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>On assignment 2 we all struggled to a degree with the technical aspects of the assignment, particularly using github. This has improved in this assignment with practice and consultation with our lecturers/tutors. However as we are all beginners in IT this is still an area where we could improve. As the creator of some of the artefacts working towards seeing the project become a reality, I would love to improve my development skills so I could add more features to the product.</p.l> 

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l> I was expecting assignment 3 to be a rather daunting undertaking, but since we had laid much of the groundwork in assignment 2 it turned out to not be too taxing. Another aspect of this – everyone in the group was keen to take on an important role, which resulted in the work load being spread across all team members. </p> 

<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>Sticking with a team over the course of a study period has allowed everyone’s strengths to be understood and utilised for the benefit of the group.</p> 

 
 

<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Max Torti</h6> 

<h4>What went well? </h4>  

<p.l>Our group is full of different experiences and skills in different fields, this came to be extremely important with our group projects. We used each other’s experience and skills while delegating workloads, as a result each member understood what was needed from them and completed it to the best of their abilities. </p> 

<h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>Our team is well fitted for many scenarios, I believe that we complete tasks to a satisfying degree. However, sometimes I feel as though we may overthink certain tasks, making us spend more time then necessary on said tasks. </p.l> 

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l>Overall, I would say the entire groups efforts and motivation towards completing our goals has been the most surprising aspect of this experience. Usually, tasks that are to be completed in groups or teams are feared and hated by most people, however, as a result of the waterLog team, I will no longer share this opinion. Each member contributes an equal amount, while also helping wherever possible.  </p.l>  

<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>As a result of this experience, I have learnt that participating in group or team projects isn’t always bad. This experience has changed the way I look at collaborating with fellow students, I now look forward to my next group project. </p.l>  

 

<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Liam O’dell</h6> 

<h4>What went well? </h4>  

<p.l>Our group has had the same consistent members through assignments 2,3 and 5. Over this time we developed from a group of people who were doing their parts into a cohesive team that is able to pickup slack where needed, specialise in their area and really contribute to the team.  </p.l>  

<h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>In assignment 2 I stated that our technical knowledge needed some improving. Through this assignment we have created artifacts, developed our HTML/CSS and worked hard on our content to make waterlog a reality. This, as well as all the work that went into assignment 2, has greatly improved my technical knowledge and that of the team.  </p.l>  

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l>I was surprised as to the level of consideration and empathy going into this group assignment. In previous assignments that I have done with a group in various courses I have always had to be the one that picks up the slack and organises everyone. Thankfully, in our group everyone is organised, diligent and hardworking. This surprised me in assignment 2 and our progress on Assignment 3 and 5 indicate that we are only improving.  </p.l>  

<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>I have learned that developing an understanding of the strengths of others is extremely beneficial. For example, if I need help with a technical problem, I can contact one of our more technically developed members like Max or If I have a questions about workflow or anything managerial I could just as Imogen. I think the other members of the group also noticed this and it made assignment 3 go a lot more smoothly than Assignment 3  </p.l>   


<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Benjamin Christy</h6> 

<h4>What went well? </h4>  

<p.l>The group worked well and consistent in most areas. Communication was great we had two meetings per week and when someone was going to be late or couldn’t make it they always let the group know. Everyone was also consistent with their work and collaboration efforts.  </p.l>  

<h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>To be honest there is not much that needs improving apart from some of our technical knowledge in certain areas, for example html and app development. If we were more experienced we could make our waterlog website more interactive and we wouldn’t have to outsource our mobile app development.   </p.l>   

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l>I was honesty surprised about how easy it is working in a team I did have doubts at the start after hearing stories from friends. Everyone is kind and if you ever had a problem or needed some help they were always there for support.  </p.l>   

<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>I have learned that working in a team can not only be beneficial for your work flow, but also for self improvement and learning as well. For instance If can’t figure out some code, or some part of an assignment, I can ask and learn from the peers in my team  </p>  

	<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Henry Robinson</h6> 
	<h4>What went well?</h4><p.l> I found that this assignment had clear and defined roles. Because we had got to know each others strengths in A2, we built off that in assigning content to each member for A3. Being able to explore building a mock GUI for the project was very fun, and all group members delivered constructive feedback.  </p.l>
	<h4>What could be improved?</h4><p.l>Personally I was pretty happy with the way this group has operated. Perhaps one aspect of our group which could be improved would be our technical skills. Some members are quite technically minded or have more  previous experience than others, but we all have many gaps in our knowledge. This is, however, to be expected as we have just started our studies.  </p.l>
	
	<h4>What was surprising?</h4><p.l>In almost every situation there was a group member who was able to offer solutions to a problem. Because problems were varied in nature, there was a fairly even spread of who was contributing to solving them.  </p.l>
	<h4>What is one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4><p.l>Group work is possible without a clear command structure. If you have a team that has mutual respect, and everybody is working hard, then there is a mutual trust that is established and sharing the leadership hat around becomes easy.  </p.l>

<h6 style="font-size:1.5vw;">Group Reflection</h6> 
<p.l> For Assignment 3, we were able to build on our strengths from our previous assignment. This enabled us to designate team members specific tasks in a very organised manner.<br>  Work was broken down and distributed to people based on our individual strengths and interests. There was a combination of continuing the same type of roles in A2 and new elements such as making front and back-end prototypes. <br> We were also happy to take on feedback from A2 regarding pushing code onto the GitHub. Specifically, we designated Ben the role of pushing code, to avoid overwriting each other's work. <br> <br> 
	
	 
	
	When we started A2, we were still getting to know each other and what our roles in the assignment would be. In A3, meetings were very efficient, and a lot of time was spent breaking down the assignment tasks. This meant that we were able to cover a lot of ground in a shorter period of time.  <br> Each member was able to chair at least one meeting and take charge in a leadership role. In a manner similar to A2, leadership in the meetings was shared and everyone was achieving the assignment goals. <br> <br> 
	
	 
	
	We were able to heavily expand on waterLog concept in A3. Fleshing out the waterLog project really helped us hone in on what the app was going to be. <br> Team members were also able to produce some artefacts to support the written concepts, including a graphic user interface, and an SQL database. These elements, along with the written content, really made the waterLog concept come to life. <br> <br> 
	
	 
	
	Based on a script from Andrew (one of the waterLog team members), we recorded a Shark Tank parody which involved a sales pitch of our waterLog idea. Recorded on MS Teams, this became the basis of our A5 idea. <br> Every team member had an on camera role, and Andrew was happy enough to edit the footage together. This assignment was a lot of fun, and our team felt very positively about the experience. On top of this, it was also a great way to finish off the class. <br> <br> 
	
	 
	
	 
	
	We had a lot of fun fleshing out waterLog into a developed concept. Taking everything into account, there was a general feeling of optimism within our group. Each member was able to contribute effectively, and communication was really strong. There was a strong cohesion from start to finish, and all members feel that it was overall a positive experience. </p.l> 

<!--<h4>What went well </h4>  

<p.l>The consensus is the group worked very well together. Everyone contributed equally, felt heard and supported. Communication and discourse were excellent, everyone attended meetings, took turns in chairing meetings, and discussed concerns, raised questions, and offered solutions via Microsoft Teams. Contribution of workload was even and equal, with each member assisting others with their delegated section as well as taking full responsibility for their own. </p.l> 

<p.l>Everyone took leadership at differing times and in areas they had the most experience and confidence in. </p.l> 

 <h4>What could be improved? </h4>  

<p.l>The lacking element amongst the group was a general knowledge of technology (thus the reason we are enrolled in this course). Github skills were certainly amateurish at the onset of the assignment, however through a collaborative effort, each group member saw steady improvement in their own skills. </p.l> 

 <h4>What was surprising? </h4>  

<p.l>Each group member initially had trepidation with regards to group work. Some had previously experienced disorderly and fragmented group environments. Each member has expressed their relief and enjoyment of the current group environment and very much look forward to engaging again for Assignment 3 and beyond. </p.l> 

<p.l>Another surprising factor was our age gaps, the youngest member being still in high school and 17 years and the oldest being almost 40. Even more surprising was the absence effect this had on the group’s ability to work together. </p.l> 

  
<h4>What have you learnt about groups? </h4>  

<p.l>Throughout the assignment, the group learnt of each other’s backgrounds, differing lives, locations and lifestyles, strengths, and weaknesses and the individual aims for the future and career goals. </p.l> 

<p.l>The group ascertained early on that each member had varied and differing schedules and to ensure cohesion, flexibility was needed. This became a positive and group asset as each member could take shifts in workloads on days or times of the day which suited each of them. </p.l> 

<p.l>Compromise, support and treating others as you wish to be treated is fundamental to any working relationship. This was an initial learning curve as each member became familiar with the other and discovered how best to offer this. </p.l>
